# Blur Loader with Three Dots Animation for macOS

This project demonstrates how to create a **modern blur loader view** with three dots animation for macOS applications using Swift and NSView.

## Features
- Three dots bouncing/fading animation
- Blur background with adjustable transparency
- Full view blocking (prevents user interaction during loading)
- Easy to reuse across projects
- Customizable colors and blur effect types

3. Import the file where needed.

## Usage
```swift
let loader = BlurLoaderView(frame: self.view.bounds)
loader.show(in: self.view)

// Hide loader after 3 seconds
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 3) {

}
